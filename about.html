<p>Hi and welcome. My name is JT and I am a 10+ year veteran of IT. While I'm not yet a greybeard, I take every opportunity to learn and grow my skills. I tend to suffer from shiny object syndrome from time to time but alas, it has brought me this far and I have enjoyed the journey fully.</p>

<p>This blog is an opportunity for me to (finally) get some content down to not only act as a resource for the future, but to document some of the things that I encounter along the way.</p>

<p class="mb-5">My passions are deeply rooted in technology, CTF challenges, space, crypto, and general l33t activities to name a few. I hope to continue my quest to document what I learn and share useful knowledge and insights with others, be it here or elsewhere.</p>
