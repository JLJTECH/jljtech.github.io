# 2021 Snippets

Every now and then I run across a helpful snippet of code. For far too long i have left them be instead of documenting, saving and including some context for their use. This has proven helpful for countless others on their journey. As such, in the interest of doing, I begin documenting some interesting finds here and now. This will be a running list until i have the bandwidth to apply more structure to the page. For now, it will maintain a very basic format...to be continued....

## Prompt
When needing to generate numbers from 0-255 and pipe them to a command via stdout. (eg. FFUF)
```bash
for i in {0..255}; do echo $i; done |
```
